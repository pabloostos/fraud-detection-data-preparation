Fraud Detection Data Preparation - Data Analytics for decision making 

Data preparation, also known as ‘preprocessing’ or ‘formatting’, consists on the act of cleaning and consolidating the raw data before submitting it to analysis. Maybe it is not the most appraised task, but performing a preparation of the data is a thorough key component for a correct data analysis.
Carrying out the process of validating, cleaning and augmenting the raw data is the foundation to obtain precise and significant insights from them. The validity and power of a data analysis depends on the efficiency of the previous preparation made.
The aim of this assignment is to practice some of the data preparation techniques through a hands-on exercise. The next variations and questions have to be answered.
